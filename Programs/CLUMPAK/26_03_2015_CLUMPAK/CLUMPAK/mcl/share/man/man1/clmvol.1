.SH NAME
clm vol \- compute volatile nodes from a set of clusterings

clmvol is not in actual fact a program\&. This manual
page documents the behaviour and options of the clm program when
invoked in mode \fIvol\fP\&. The options \fB-h\fP, \fB--apropos\fP,
\fB--version\fP, \fB-set\fP, \fB--nop\fP are accessible
in all \fBclm\fP modes\&. They are described
in the \fBclm\fP manual page\&.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBclm vol\fP
\fB[-fraction\fP num (\fInff factor\fP)\fB]\fP
\fB[-o\fP fname (\fIoutput file\fP)\fB]\fP
<cl file>+
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBclm vol\fP computes a score for each node, which at a minimum is equal to one\&.
The output is in the form of a matrix containing a single column\&. The score
correlates with what is deemed to be volatile behaviour\&. For all pairs of
clusterings the set of all intersections is computed, and these are
considered in turn\&.
An intersection is deemed to be volatile if the size of the intersection is
less than half the size of the smallest of the two clusters\&. In that case,
for each node in the intersection its volatility score is incremented by one
over the size of the intersection\&.
The size comparison can be made more stringent by increasing the
\fB-fraction\fP\ \&\fI<frac>\fP option, which is by default set to \fC0\&.5\fP\&.
Volatility occurs if the size of the intersection is less than
\fB<frac>\fP times the size of the smallest cluster\&. If the
\fB-fraction\fP value is increased all the way up to 1\&.0, the implication
is that an intersection is considered volatile unless one of the two
clusteres considered is a subset of the other\&.
