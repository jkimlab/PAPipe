# Multiple runs of PAPipe for population genetic analyses 

- Using the same variant calling results, PAPipe can be run multiple times with different parameter values.
- This feature is supported only for population genetic analyses, not for the previous steps, such as read trimming, read mapping, genetic variant calling, and data filtering and format converting
